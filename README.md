# Spam-mail-classifier-using-machine-learning
This project focuses on detecting and blocking fake or malicious links using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes various features of URLs, such as structure, domain information, and content patterns, to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent links. By training machine learning models on labeled datasets of real and fake URLs, the proposed solution can accurately identify suspicious links in real time. This helps protect users from phishing attacks, malware, and online fraud, thereby improving overall cybersecurity and safe browsing experiences.
